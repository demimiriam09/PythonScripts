"""Write a Python program that does the following:
1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
o	Addition
o	Subtraction
o	Multiplication
o	Division
3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
 Expected Output:
The output should include the result of each operation performed, for example:


num1= float(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2= float(input("Enter the second number: "))

addition = num1 + num2
subtraction = num1 - num2
multiplication = num1 * num2
division = num1 / num2
print("Addition:", addition)
print("Subtraction:", subtraction)
print("Multiplication:", multiplication)
print("Division:", division)

firstname = input("Enter your first name: ")
lastname = input("Enter your last name: ")
fullname = firstname + " " + lastname
print("Hello, " + fullname + "! Welcome to the Python program")
